I have been obsessing over Merlin Mann the past few days, and for anyone who is familiar with him you will immediately understand why.  He is a brilliant person, with a ton of muddled and/or ridiculous points to make.  And I mean come on, what makes a better person than that?  

He is the creator of [Inbox Zero](http://youtu.be/z9UjeTMb3Yk), the [Hipster PDA](http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/03/introducing-the-hipster-pda), stars on [Back to Work](http://5by5.tv/b2w), and has and continues to help create other such geekery and nonsense.  Personally, I love him for the talks that he does on the broad spectrum of time and attention (a la, [this](http://vimeo.com/7192517) and [this](http://youtu.be/QwRrpCWTiOY).

In fact, as I am sitting here typing this I am finishing up a little talk he gave to himself and his computer monitor regarding the fear we all have with our own lives.  The fear we all have to get things done, and the fear we all have in our own ability to fail in the face of progress.  These topics all hit home, and as you can imagine being twenty three years old is like asking for these topics to manifest so you can help them take over your mind.  

It's an eternal catch-22, or a perilous paradox within our own creativity.  The more you yearn to create and be an actually productive individual, the less you will do so.  The more you focus on habits and tips, tricks and hacks - the less you will actually use them.  Now, maybe you are the 1%'ers and these thoughts don't apply to you.  Maybe you are just eternally productive, and never have had nor will ever have a problem with it.  Maybe you are also the right weight when you check the scale, but I doubt it.  The reason we check the scale is because we have a belief that we aren't what we would like to be, and yet does that scale help at all with anything other than fear and anxiety?  I bet not.  When is the last time you have used the scale alone as an actual reference point, and not a self-guilt tool?  Without a piece of paper to jot down information about weight changes over time, I bet you never have.  If we don't introduce the recording of the events over time into this equation for weight loss, we will never leave the self-guilt and/or anxiety-fear cycles.  Same goes for your productivity.  Until you **implement** what you are learning, it means very little.  

Implementation doesn't have to be a solid, and rigid set of barriers and boundaries.  Experiments are where it's at, and in fact where its always been.  Little do we know about ourselves without experimenting, and little do we know about what we want to do or be without experimenting.  Let this apply to productivity, and your use of systems as well.  Constantly experiment.  Getting things done, Zen to done, 80/20, Pomodoro, there are so many systems out there.  I want you to try them all, and to constantly iterate on what is the best for you.  Take a little bit from each one, move on to the next - learn - iterate - refactor - until you **love** your new system.  Craft your own productivity system.  After all, it's the only way to re-invent your magic.
