Fires are burning.

Infrastructure is melting down.

People are quitting.

Departments and teams are flailing.

KPIs and metrics are being obscured.

Meetings are stacking up.

The vibe is changing.

Negativity is on the rise.

Politics are growing.

Paranoia is increasing.

****

This is an example of what happens in most organizations, at some point, each year they exist.

Unfortunatelyâ€Š-â€Šthe problem isn't the organizationâ€Š-â€Šit's how we react to this entropy.

Are you the lighthouse in the middle of the ocean that stands with certainty, looking forward with vision that won't shake you?

Or are you willing to let all of this unravel your sanity?
Please, for the love of your sanity and health, choose certainty.

Choose to be certain:
* That things are always getting better in the medium/long-term
* That the vibe will twist and turn on its path to greatness
* That the teams will flail until they land on solid footing
* That people will be uncertain in the midst of the storm
* That our energy and certainty can be used to help others feel safe

Without that certainty and safety as a cultural value, it's hard to act against the massive force of organizational Entropy that results in a growing organization.

And that's our job.

We often forget, but combating entropy is always our Chief Aim.
