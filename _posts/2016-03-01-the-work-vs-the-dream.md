> “All I gotta do is go and get a copy of XCode 4.2 and I’m good to go. I’ll just slap this together and retire on my angry bird.”&nbsp;- Merlin Mann

If all it took was&nbsp;a new notebook to write the next Great Gatsby, the publishing industry would have died in 1926. &nbsp;Unfortunately such a dream is why a lot of us obsess over systems, and the practical tools therein. &nbsp;I hate to be the bad news bear, but that isn't how it works. &nbsp;You know this on some level, and yet you still don't participate in the belief that this could benefit you. &nbsp;Why not work hard for something than you can achieve without working at all? &nbsp;It's a brilliant system, or meta-system rather. &nbsp;The system that procrastination produces, and ignorance is based. &nbsp;

It's pretty easy to find out for yourself if you are a follower of a meta-system for procrastination, or a nimble system for accomplishing the things you want: just look in your garden for a zombie fight, or underneath you for an angry bird. &nbsp;Perhaps to your friends forehead for a +1 button, or a card table for a Recommendation. &nbsp;Chances are, none of these will be familiar to you - and you, like the rest of us, will have to work to achieve what it is you want. &nbsp;Don't be disheartened though, this is a great life - just ask [Steven King](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King#Writing_style). &nbsp;
