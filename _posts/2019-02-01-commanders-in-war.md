There’s incredible value in books about war, from generals and commanders on the battlefield.

They learn the lessons that we all do, except they learn them with hyper clarity.

The fog of war applies, but not to the moments in combat when the realities of lessons learnt hit you. They hit you with the most extreme clarity. At least, that’s what the author of this book and others have said.

I’m reading another book right now about Apache helicopter pilots in Iraq. But not just any helicopter pilots, these were the pararescue (Air Force) and Night Stalkers (Army Special Forces) and their job was to go into a hot combat zone to medivac downed soldiers. And basically it was the most dangerous job imaginable. They were constantly being shot down. And every time they left base, they knew it was 50/50 if they died or lived.

Imagine living with that type of uncertainty. That type of fear.

You have no other choice but to conquer the fear and enjoy every little moment you have.

My take away guys from people who have experienced things like that, is that they are literally on a higher level of consciousness because of it.

They are able to perceive their own gratitude for life with SUCH CLARITY that they are living in a higher more evolved area.

So please read books like this, learn how these people think after experiencing what you never will, and annex their thinking as Seneca said: suck it into your own brain.

Be grateful for every moment of life. And take it, with full advantage.
