Don't let this scenario represent your management style…

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2484/1*oorM8VX41V7Zz64jRtNkjg.png)

Management isn't management, it's just friendship.

Can we stop acting like business isn't the same as the rest of our life?

To be more specific: management is leadership, and if you can figure out leadership (& add constraints) you have management.

Leadership is defined by your ability to build friendships with those around you who are willing to believe in you, and when the time is right - you are presented with the opportunity to hold the light and shine the way to a murky future that you can for some reason obviously see. And ofc leadership takes 1,000 shapes and forms, & that's probably only one aspect of it.

But for today, it's an important one.

## Here's how that plays into fixing the problem in the tweet above:

- Talk to your directs [FRIENDS] and get to know them, get to know what they struggle with and what their strengths are. Then, later, you can help them to develop those strengths. Do this through, literally, becoming friends not just 1:1s. Go get coffee, goto drinks (where appropriate), etc.
- Gift knowledge regularly. Just this month the tally is 4 books gifted. I leave them on the desk of the person I'm gifting with a 1 line note and no expectation. The books are relevant to challenges that person is dealing with (or better yet the GOALS we have set for them). Sometimes it's more lifey like stoicism, but it's always something deeply valuable.
- Encourage your directs (friends) to find ways (and help them) to establish work projects that are tailored towards growing their strengths and lessening their weaknesses. If need be coach them on who would be a great coupling to balance out a weakness on their future teams, and if nothing else they have that archetype in mind for next time they build a team.
- Sample the work on the front-line with them, 1 time per fortnight. Why? You can help guide them and handle any big issues ahead of time and allow them to feel like they have a partner. You want them to feel like "Wow, my boss is my partner." And additionally, have a skip level meeting with the direct's directs. Find some way to find out how the work itself is going. Often times, in big organizations, there can be a reluctance to be "honest" about another persons thinking not being accurate or logical, esp. as groups and teams get bigger. So we end up in these situations where there is an intense inefficient and ineffective action going on for many years. Based on my experience in corporations, I'd say this is why startups can disrupt corporations. I've seen unbelievable waste.


## Some additional ninja tricks:

- Consistently referring to that future state that person wants. Spoiler alert: to get here you have to be friends enough & talk to the person to KNOW WHAT future state this person wants.
- Encourage people to believe that what we/they want is possible, and help them build that future state they want.
- Remember that empowering them through huge changes at work, means overall wellbeing in life increases. (Impact breakdown: work=the goal itself, life=the accomplishment of the goal)
- Do the above consistently to develop an unstoppable team large enough to attack the problem you want to lead them towards.
