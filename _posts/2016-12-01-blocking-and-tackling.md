Starting is the hardest thing there is, bar none. &nbsp;I don’t care if it is a project, homework, or a corporate business plan; it is always difficult. &nbsp;It is so difficult that typically people don’t start at all. &nbsp;They follow down the road of procrastination and that leads them to not getting meaningful work accomplished. &nbsp;I’ve certainly talked about doing meaningful work on this blog before, and I stand by what I’ve said. &nbsp;I’ve also certainly talked about fiddling, and how it can be detrimental and helpful to productivity all at the same time - again, which I stand by. &nbsp;But aside from all that I think we just need to start things more often.&nbsp;

To give you an example on what holds me up here are some of the common blocks I have: living off the todo list, starting things, writing in general (I know right?), and project scope. &nbsp;The most important of which being the first, and I’ll tell you why. &nbsp;Often times we can have one or two tasks that block us and we don’t even realize it. &nbsp;There may be one or two things that just totally stop us from accomplishing anything else that day, and it can be a minor thing at that. &nbsp;We may feel guilty about not having it completed (which leads to more procrastination), or we could feel that we are going to never finish it because the project hasn’t been broken down appropriately. &nbsp;Or it could be anything in between. &nbsp;These are massive problems, and if there was a real task system out there it would have a little check box that says, “Is this task blocking you?”, and once you checked it - it would disappear until you turned on your computer the next morning. &nbsp;Unfortunately that doesn’t exist in personal productivity systems, typically. &nbsp;So what I propose is that you create it. &nbsp;If you see a task that is blocking you just check it off as completed, and then circle back to it later. &nbsp;This will save you a lot of headache in the long run.

Another small tip is to use verbs and nouns appropriately. &nbsp;Figure out if you are a noun or verb guy (Ie, "wash dishes" vs "dishes"), and then swim into that as hard as you can. &nbsp;If a task is blocking you consider its wording. &nbsp;For instance, if it is a phone call, change it to email, if it is an email - change it to phone call. &nbsp;Manipulate your lists and don't let them manipulate you. &nbsp;
