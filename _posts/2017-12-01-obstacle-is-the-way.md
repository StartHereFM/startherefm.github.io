Excerpt:

> 
> No one is coming to save you. And if we’d like to go where we claim we want to go - to accomplish what we claim are our goals - there is only one way. And that’s to meet our problems with the right action.
> 
> Therefore, we can always (and only) greet our obtsacles:
> - with energy
> - with persistence
> - with a coherent and deliberate process
> - with iteration and resilience
> - with pragmatism
> - with strategic vision
> - with craftiness and savvy
> - with an eye for opportunity and pivotal moments
