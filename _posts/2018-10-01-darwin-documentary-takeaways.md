* Darwin spent 5 years at sea collecting samples before he started analyzing any of them. Then, back at his home in England, he began reviewing them. He understood the seasons of life at almost an expert level.
* Darwin would perform ‘stream of consciousness’ or ‘mental rioting’, as he called it, in which he’d write notebooks worth of thought until something solidifies.
* Whales have teeth in their embryo, but they don’t exist in adult whales because of Darwinistic changes throughout the lives of multiple generations of whale.
* Darwin realized that creatures change before he knew why they changed. Thus, allowing himself to have insight before comprehension.
The most brutal things in nature (aka the most extreme conflict like death of an animal from another) is actually the most creative possible thing for the gene pool. Fascinating.
