Something that's fascinated me recently is the pervasiveness of the human spirit. &nbsp;For instance, we might all face downtrodden behavior, horrible people, greedy looks, or inhumane behavior -&nbsp;but in the end we all prevail. &nbsp;We don't all prevail&nbsp;in the sense of success, fortune, or happiness, we all prevail&nbsp;_with_ the human spirit. &nbsp;We move the spirit with us through time. &nbsp;We prevail&nbsp;at being, at having emotions, at having incapabilities and being and accepting those as we live. &nbsp;We prevail at justice, and wrongdoing, at godliness, and at passion. &nbsp;Some&nbsp;prevail at abuse, drugs,&nbsp;felonious&nbsp;behavior - but that doesn't make them any less prevalent. &nbsp;The human spirit lives through us all and as we dance, so to it dances, on the edge of our bodies - watching our energy as we walk the world. &nbsp;It reflects with our energy, and accepts our duality. &nbsp;It doesn't care what color we are or where we came from, it only cares about understanding and reflection. &nbsp;A reflection of us, and a reflection of the power within. &nbsp;A reflection of all the good deeds and beautiful moments that have ever existed, a reflection of the wonder in the curiosity of nature, a reflection of the&nbsp;steadfastness&nbsp;of those whose opinions were more right than wrong. &nbsp;And as long as we are here, so to will the human spirit. &nbsp;And for that, I am the most grateful. &nbsp;
