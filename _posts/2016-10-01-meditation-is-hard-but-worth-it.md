Early on in my practice, one of my meditation teachers once asked his teacher for advice on dealing with the pain he was experiencing while trying to sit in full-lotus position (this is tough for most westerners).

His teacher replied, “If it’s painful for you, don’t do it. You don’t need to go looking for difficulty, meditation is hard enough as it is.”
