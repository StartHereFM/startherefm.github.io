I see a lot of pessimism out in the world. And I’m sure you all do as well.

But, people are often pessimistic about the wrong things.

In general, 95% of people are freaking out over the wrong things.

What do most people freak out about?

They freak out about their car 🚗, their clothes 👗, their selfies and phones📱, their makeup 💄, their hair 💇, other people’s opinions 😈, and so much other total bullshit.

Jim Rohn calls this “majoring in the minors”. He says that most people minor in the majors, and major in the minors. I’ve found this to be true.

Most people are freaking out over things that they can not control, and are not freaking out about what they can control but aren’t. 

So what should we freak out about?

You should freak out if they are living the wrong life.

You should freak out if they are wasting years in a bad relationship.

You should freak out if they are in a rut, stuck, not moving forward, or making progress.

You should freak out if they don’t have their finances in 100% pristine condition, no excuses.

You should freak out if you aren’t taking care of the ONE BODY YOU WERE GIVEN.

You should freak out if you are not learning something new everyday.

You should freak out if you don’t have mentors in your life who are 20 years ahead of you, YOU SHOULD FREAK OUT.

What would you prefer:

*****

> Wear matching socks for the next 3 years.

or

> Make half a million dollars in the next 3 years.

*****

That sounds so ridiculous, but you’d be surprised. It’s more right than it is wrong.

You can not possibly grow to the type of person needed to make one million dollars without OBSCENE focus and relentless care in the ONE THING aka your life’s mission.

And there’s no secret formula.

The reason you must have focus on the right things, the reason you must MAJOR IN THE MAJORS is because you WILL NOT BE MOTIVATED to do the work it takes to make 1 million dollars if not. You are probably not specific enough, you are probably too broad. You don’t know what you want to do to the degree you would be motivated to do enough work to make 1 million dollars in it.

Most people in our society are wishing for a better life, without being willing (aka motivated) to do the work it takes to be a better person. It doesn’t work that way.

So, pessimism is important, if it’s applied to the right things.

Be pessimistic about living forever. Because guess what – you won’t!! 👻

Be pessimistic about having unlimited time, because you can’t. ⏲

Let that fuel you 🚀 to take advantage of every minute, to take advantage of EVERY SECOND you have on this planet 🌏.

And if you are in a rut, or haven’t been doing what you know you should be, that’s fine. Don’t beat yourself up.

Life is nothing but a series of little decisions. The character of the world’s greatest men and women is just a series of little decisions they made that turned them into who they were and are.

And you too can become one of those great men or women right now. It’s all in the decisions you make.

So, what decisions are you going to make?

How are YOU going to spend the rest of your week?

What are YOU going to do to improve your health 🏋, wealth 💰, love ❤️, and happiness 😀?

How are YOU going to spend the weekend?

What are you going to do to better YOURSELF?

Because nobody else is going to do it for you. Make a commitment to take the actions, to change the habits, and to make better decisions. Make that commitment right now at this very moment. The next moments leading up until the day that you die are not guaranteed for you. Time is ticking, and we need you to take advantage to help make this world a better place.

Grow or die. Bye for now.
