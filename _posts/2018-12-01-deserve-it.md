If you want to get what you want, you must deserve what you want.

Look down at your keyboard, do you know what f6 does? Do you know what the interest over 5 years of your savings account is with inflation and fees factored in?

If you want to change the world you need to up your awareness factor. Your worst enemy should be a feeling of “I don’t care”. You should care. You should care about everything.

You will only have what you understand. Not because of some magical law of attraction, rather because if you don’t understand something you are likely to mismanage your relationship with it.

I hope that scares you. I hope that keeps you up at night.

People seem to have been deluded into thinking they should be kept up at night from their job, or unpaid bills. Whereas conversely some believe nothing should ever keep them so on edge that they can’t sleep. I’m here to squash that bullshit right now.

There are certain things that should keep you up at night – like your lack of knowledge and how little you understand of every single thing going on around you. Just sitting up worrying about bills isn’t going to do anything for you. Nor will feeling like you are deserving of no stress ever. Do you really deserve no stress? I know I’m not. There’s some things I haven’t mastered. Thousands of things.

Let’s not forget the most important quote from Richard Dawkins about evolutionary pressure:

> Eustress is NOT the same thing as distress.

If you want to get what you want, you must deserve what you want. Acquiring knowledge is the fastest way to that. Acquire awareness of your surroundings. Never let it be said that you didn’t learn.
But always keep in mind the most important thing about knowledge acquisition – it means nothing if you don’t act on it.
