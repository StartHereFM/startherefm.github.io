> "CERNâ€™s Higgs boson discovery passes peer review, becomes actual science" - Sebastian Anthony via [this article](http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/135756-cerns-higgs-boson-discovery-passes-peer-review-becomes-actual-science).

This is monumental for science, and science geeks alike. I hope to see an increase in science fiction around this mythical particle, and will be quite disappointed should such a thing not happen. But no this is definitely an amazing discovery. For the first time we have observed the particle that actually gives mass, well... mass. It is pretty brilliant in theory, and now that we have peer reviewed experimentation of it who knows what it will lead to. I am excited.
