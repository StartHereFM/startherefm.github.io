I’ve always had a problem using the terminal on Windows. It is cumbersome, ridiculous, riddled with unnecessary items, and on top of that it didn’t have all the joys of a **nix terminal**. So, fast forward 10 years to when I bought my first iMac. I was in a world of pleasure. The nix terminal that it has was just what I needed. It was beautiful, and it welcomed a world of possibilities. Git, SVN, grepping, curling, diffing, and much more were possible with just a few simple but perhaps hard to remember keystrokes.

On that note enter [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/). Oh my zsh is a command line utility that helps in a ton of ways. It creates aliases for simple but often used bash commands such as ls and history viewing, grepping, etc. It also offers a robust structure for themeifying your terminal so that you can always see what you are doing when in a version control system. Often times I will be in a git repository that has 5 branches or at least 2 or 3, and it is certainly cumbersome to have to type git branch to see which ones are active. With oh-my-zsh I can see what branch I am in right alongside the terminal text . Here is a screenshot so you know what I mean:

It is incredibly useful. I would suggest that everyone go and pick it up as soon as you can, but before you do let me say something. For a long while I heard and saw the power of oh-my-zsh but I didn’t pick it up because I didn’t want to learn another language. I’ve already learned bash, ruby, python, and coffeescript to an extreme extent this year and I didn’t feel like taking on another one. So let me just be the one that tells you; there is literally nothing to learn. “l” does the same as ‘ls -la’ on the dir. “ls” does the same it always has. “g” greps. ‘history’ views entire history on the dir. “…” is the same as “cd ../..” and “..” is the same as “cd..”. It is just brilliantly useful. As you can see it is effectively like textexpander or some time saving utility for the terminal. It humanizes the terminal and helps you figure out how to use the most advanced feature. For instance, I never did ‘fc -l 1’ before, but I am doing ‘history’ all the time now. It is essentially git status but for local dirs. Brilliant. Now go to their [github page](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/), and grab it up. Contribute if you can, and let's keep spreading the love.
