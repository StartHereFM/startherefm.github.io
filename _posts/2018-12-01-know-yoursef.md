How well do you know yourself?

![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160315170419im_/http://dain.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/FA5BD020-FCC8-4F93-9A04-2FA69BFC738A-1100x1143.png)

What type of learner are you? Do you learn from taking notes? Do you generate your best ideas when talking to other people?

If there is even a shade of ambiguity in your answers to the above questions, then you are leaving money and impact on the table.

Do you want to impact the world, and help change things? Do you want to be financially independent? Then you better know yourself.

You should know how you best learn, how you generate ideas, what time of day is best for you to work in, when your Einstein window is, wether your a night owl or an early bird. You should know what you are on the Meyers Briggs test, and what you are on the Hexico test.

You should be OBSESSED with finding out as much about yourself as humanly possible. How crazy is it that we live in a world where people know more about Kim Kardashian than they do themselves. They know more about their favorite tv shows than they do themselves.

I get it, it’s painful to sit and think about ourselves. We have so much negative emotion wrapped up in ourselves it is incredibly painful to think about. When you try to consider what type of learner you are, you might think of something bad that’s happened to you in the past at school or how unhappy you are with how little you’ve learned.

But whatever you do, don’t let that pain turn into delusion. Instead let that pain drive you. Let it instinctually change you.

Your brain is the biggest drug dealer on the planet. The minute you want to sit down and watch Netflix to avoid some pain you are thinking of, you should freak out. You should at that moment let all the pain you are deluded into avoiding come to the surface, but don’t let it turn you into a jaded mess.

Instead point all of that pain at the part of your brain that wants you to embrace short term pleasure at the sacrifice of long term happiness. You should be at WAR with your amygdala. Seth Godin calls it “the resistance” and “the reptile brain”. You should be at WAR with it.

Go to war with the resistance, if not it just might allow you to waste your life.

Grab these three books, but start with “Managing Oneself”. They will help you win the war.
