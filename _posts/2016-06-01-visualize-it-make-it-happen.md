Visualize what you want, and get ready to be&nbsp;bequeathed&nbsp;upon. &nbsp;At least, that is what the book&nbsp;[The Secret](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_(book)) would have you believe. &nbsp;How could we all not want a Cosmic ATM that comes equipped with a delivery driver and no limit? &nbsp;Well, that was that is just the best rhetorical question, because the answer is obvious. &nbsp;And although this sounds dreamy scientists have called bullshit. &nbsp;

Scientists want an unlimited potential for manifestinig their dreams as much as we do, and because of this some have gone so far as to research the seemingly esoteric topic that is 'visualization'. &nbsp;In the book [59 Seconds](http://www.amazon.com/59-Seconds-Little-Change-Borzoi/dp/0307273407), [Richard Wiseman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wiseman)&nbsp;shares the research from scientists studying just that. &nbsp;It turns out that when you imagine having what you want, you are actually less likely to get it. &nbsp;It seems this is true for romance, weight control, lifestyle change, and just about anything else. &nbsp;Most self help programs tell us to feel as though we have already reached our goal, which doesn't work, so then we have to come back and buy more self help books (which works for them). &nbsp;This is a recurssive and never ending cycle, and what the real research shows is that when we feel like we already have what we want we are less motivated and less likely to&nbsp;persevere&nbsp;when faced with the hardships that come with achieving such a goal. &nbsp;Of course, we can have spiritual debates on the importance of third-eye'ng your goal (which may be important on a more&nbsp;ethereal&nbsp;level), but the facts and studies seem to show something much different. &nbsp;

Now, if all of that is true then what is the 'real' secret? &nbsp;What is the real key to life that nobody has told us? &nbsp;There has to be one, right? &nbsp; Well, here are a few 'real' ways to visualize.

> *   Visualize your progress, not the end result. &nbsp;It is important to imagine, but don't imagine having the goal. &nbsp;Imagine yourself taking the steps necessary to reach it. &nbsp;Instead of programming your brain to think, "I'M THERE" you are programming your brain to do the work that will get you there.
> *   Visualize from the third person, not from your perspective. &nbsp;When you see yourself doing something in your mind you feel compelled to go do it. &nbsp;Monkey see, monkey do.
> *   Be optimistically realistic. &nbsp;[The Stockdale Paradox](http://www.ndoherty.com/stockdale-paradox/) - "You must never confuse faith with the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality, no matter what they may be." &nbsp;Combine optimistic inspiration with real world problem solving.&nbsp;

With these in mind (and with this new direction for visualizing) you can extrapolate your own tips and tricks. &nbsp;Be sure to try that, and remember that constant experimentation is one of the quickest ways to evolve.

_Note: 'The Secret' book asks for effort on all levels, not just a want or desire to achieve your goal. &nbsp;The problem, though, is that people have taken it as meaning 'to want or desire something that will then manifest' solely - to which there is a fundamental flaw._
